/* Revisions and History */
2005-03-17 Initial version
2005-07-21 Revised to new site and location.  Revised forecasting
	   functions to match the Political Analysis paper by Brandt
           and Freeman.
2005-09-15 Revised documentation and code to pass checks for generics.
	   Included Israeli-Palestinian dataset for examples.
2005-10-18 Incorporates preliminary functions for Bayesian SVAR models.
2006-01-19 Updated calls to Matrix package so they do not default to
           using sparse matrices in MSBVAR functions.
2006-01-29 Revised impulse response plotting functions to plot shocks
           / impulses in the columns and responses in the rows. The
	   code was documented to work this way, but delivered an
           incorrect plot.  Also changed the irf.var() function so
	   that it used an UPPER triangular A0 matrix rather than a
           lower one (the former is consistent with the return from
           chol()).
2006-02-01 Updated plotting functions for IRFs to use correct ylims
           for response plots.
2006-02-02 Removed creation of "L" in the LU decomposition used to
           backsolve structural VAR systems in "drawA0".  The U's from
	   the lu(t(A0)) are valid -- sometimes the Matrix library
           cannot generate a well behaved L, but it is not necessary
	   for the Gibbs sampler.
2006-02-10 Changed starting value computation for structural.szbvar()
	   from a set of N(0,25) to N(0,1).
	   Added a tolerance of 1e-12 to QR decompositions in drawing
           A(0) for B-SVAR models.
2006-02-18 Version 0.1.6
	   Replaced LU decompositions with QR
           decompositions in the computation of the orthonormal basis
           of the B-SVAR model posterior sampling.
	   Removed dependency on matrix package by replacing LU
           decompositions with QR decompositions
2006-02-24 Corrected limits for plots in plot.irf.var().  Previous
           versions could truncate the plot axes incorrectly.
2006-03-02 Corrected an error in the computation of the marginal data
           density for B-SVAR models.  Optimized code for computing
           posterior fit measures for
	   posterior.fit.structural.szbvar()
2006-03-07 Corrected overflow error in some computations of the log
	   determinants in posterior.fit.structural.szbvar() by
	   changing the computation of the log determinant for a
	   diagonal matrix to the simpler sum of the diagonal
           elements or using the determinant(,logarithm=T) function. 
2006-03-15 Version 0.1.9
	   1) Added option to change normalization rules for A(0) in
           sampling the structural parameters of B-SVAR models.
           Previous versions had hard coded the normalization.  New
	   version supports all of the normalization rules in
	   normalize.svar().  Documentation for this change has been
           updated as well.
2006-03-15 Version 0.1.10	
	   1) Corrected matrix inversion of A(0) in
	   mc.irf.structural.szbvar() and mcmc.structural.szbvar().
	   Previous version were possibly zeroing out A(0) terms
	   incorrectly when computing IRFs.  This did NOT affect the
	   sampling of IRFs using gibbs.A0.structural.szbvar().
	   2) Corrected indexing of AR coefficients and intercepts for
           the output object in reduced.form.var().  Previous version
	   selected the wrong coefficients for the intercept and AR(1)
	   terms.
2006-03-17 Version 0.1.11 
	   Changed order of arguments in gibbs.A0.structural.szbvar()
	   so that the normalization options do not break older
	   code.
2006-03-26 Added forced matrix via as.matrix for testing Ui object
	   dimensions in b2a function in hidden.R
2006-04-01 Version 0.1.12
	   Now requires "coda" package.
	   Flattened the A0 and W objects that are output by gibbs.A0
	   function to conserve memory.  Lowers the memory overhead
           for B-SVAR models by nearly 70% allowing for longer runs of
	   the Gibbs sampler.
	   Added function "A02mcmc" to convert A0 posterior draws to
           coda mcmc objects.
2006-04-06 Changed selection criteria in var.lag.specification to
           include the Hannan-Quinn measure and to minimize fit
	   criteria.
2006-04-07 Added a check on the rank of the exogenous variables to the
	   structural.szbvar() function.
2006-06-18 Implemented classes for VAR, BVAR, and B-SVAR models.
	   Class based dispatching is now available for most
	   post-estimation tasks such as impulse responses, Monte
	   Carlo sampling, plotting, etc.   Some function names have
	   changed from previous (post 0.1.1) versions.  Please be
	   aware of this.
2006-07-15 Revised documentation to account for new class-based
	   dispatching.
2006-09-19 Corrected incorrect handling of intercepts in
           reduced.form.var() function.  Previous version thought the
	   intercept was the first, when it should be the last
	   coefficient row.  Updated to 0.2.1.  Thanks to Pu Chen of the
	   New School for finding this.
2007-01-11 Version 0.2.2 
	   Fixed bugs in plotting of IRFs.  Sometimes the plotting
	   would fail for certain classes of VARs.  Updated dfev.BSVAR
	   to use the correctly transposed BSVAR A(0) matrix.  Noted
	   this in the documentation of dfev() as well.  Added summary
	   and print methods for the estimation methods reduced.form.var(),
	   szbvar(), and szbsvar().  These print output from the estimation in
           matrix formats.  See the documentation of the print() and summary()
	   methods for details.  Updated SZ.prior.evaluation() to all
	   a list of values for all hyperparameters.  This function
	   has also been further optimized and is now several times
	   faster.
2007-01-13 Fixed A(0) inputs in dfev() and forecast().  Also fixed a
	   scoping bug in the input of exogenous variables for
	   forecast().  Added reduced form exog.coefs to the return
	   list for szbsvar() so that they can be used in
	   forecast(). Additional bug fixes to pass check on R 2.4.1.
2007-01-14 Added BCF data that is used in the JSS piece.
